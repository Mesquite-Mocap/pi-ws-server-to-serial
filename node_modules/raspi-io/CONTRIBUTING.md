# Contributing to Raspi-IO

So you're interested in contributing to Raspi IO. That's awesome, go you! This document provides information on various ways that you can help out the project.

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you run into a bug, or would like to see a new feature added to Raspi-IO, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/issues).

When submitting a bug report, please include the following information:

- Which Raspberry Pi you are using, e.g. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
- Which version of Raspbian you are using, e.g. 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy
- Which version of Node.js or io.js you are using, e.g. Node.js 0.12.6
- A minimum reproducible test case, i.e. a short snippet that demonstrates the bug, if applicable

## Submitting Code

Code is written either in ECMAScript 2015 (previously known as ECMAscript 6 or ES6) or TypeScript 2.0. We use ESLint and TSLint to lint the code, and Babel or TypeScript to compile the code to ES5.

To build the project, run ```npm run build``` from the top level directory of each repository.

The first step in the compile process lints the code to check for issues and to ensure code style conformity. The goal of code linting is to make the pull request process easier (and make sure that Bryan doesn't do something silly ðŸ˜„).

If you are unfamiliar with ES2015, take a look at [Babel's Learn EES2015 page](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/). If you are unfamiliar with TypeScript, take a look at the [TypeScript homepage](http://typescriptlang.org/).

### Raspi IO and Raspi.js modular architecture

Raspi IO uses a modular architecture, and is composed of several different npm packages. These packages are split into two groups: Raspi IO and Raspi.js. Raspi.js provides a Raspberry Pi specific API for working with the Raspberry Pi's hardware, and Raspi IO acts as a translation layer between Johnny-Five and Raspi.js. Raspi IO is composed of two packages, raspi-io (this repository) and [raspi-io-core](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io-core), and every
